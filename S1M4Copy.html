        <p>Shakur was born on June 16, 1971, in East Harlem, Upper Manhattan, 
            New York City.[18][19][20][21] While born Lesane Parish Crooks,
            [22][23][24] at age one he was renamed Tupac Amaru Shakur.[25] He was
             named after TÃºpac Amaru II, the descendant of the last Incan ruler,
              who was executed in Peru in 1781 after his failed revolt against
               Spanish rule.[26] Shakur's mother Afeni Shakur explained, "I 
               wanted him to have the name of revolutionary, indigenous people
                in the world. I wanted him to know he was part of a world 
                culture and not just from a neighborhood.</p>

               concert for Shakur and his rap group Strictly Dope. Steinberg
                managed to get Shakur signed by Atron Gregory, manager of the
                 rap group Digital Underground.[49] In 1990, Gregory placed him
                  with the Underground as a roadie and backup dancer.[49][56]
